Network Layer
=============

.. note::
    Through this page is titled "Network Layer", we will only discuss one
    protocol in the Network Layer - IP, the Internet Protocol

    There are a few other protocols in layer 3, mentioned `here
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_network_protocols_(OSI_model)
    #Layer_3_(Network_Layer)>`_.
    
    But most of them aren't of interest to us... The one's that are
    somewhat interesting are

    * IP (v4 and v6)
    * ICMP
    * ARP
    * NAT

    The remaining protocols are either obsolete, or used only in proprietary
    or closed source softwares.

    Also, among the ones listed above, IP is the most-well known to normal
    users. This is because both TCP and UDP use IP as the underlying network
    layer protocol.

.. note::
    Often, the protocols used in the working of the internet are
    termed the `Internet Protocol Suite`_
